## Introduction

The **Data Foundations Documentation** is the central reference point for all datasets, tools, and processes managed by the Data Foundations team. It provides structured details on dataset architecture, scheduling, ownership, and business use cases, making it easier for teams to access reliable and consistent information.

This documentation covers both **On-Platform** and **Off-Platform** datasets and systems. Over time, it will expand into a single source of truth for data reliability, governance, and usage across the organization.
